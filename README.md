## This website serves as my professional portfolio and resume

This portfolio was made for the UNCC Coding Bootcamp Challenge #2. I plan on revisiting this in the future to expand and update it as I grow as a developer.

## This portfolio contains:

1. A breif about section with a photo of myself.
2. A section cataloguing specific projects that I want to share.
3. A contact section with my email address.
